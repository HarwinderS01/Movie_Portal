# **Movie Portal Project**

## **Project Overview**

The **Movie Portal Project** is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage a collection of movies. This project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a movie database, using modern web technologies and best practices for both frontend and backend development.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**  
- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering and client-side navigation for a seamless user experience.

### **Backend**  
- **API Routes**: Handle CRUD operations within the Next.js framework.  
- **Prisma ORM**: Enables type-safe and efficient database operations.

### **Database**  
- **MongoDB**: Used to store and manage movie records.  
- **Prisma Integration**: Allows seamless querying and mutation of MongoDB data.

### **Styling**  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Ensures a responsive and modern design across all devices.

### **Deployment**  
- **Vercel**: Provides hosting and continuous integration for the project, enabling fast and reliable production builds.
